# US Bike-share

## Date created

2021-09-17

## Description

Python code for exploring data from Divvy and other bike-share companies from U.S.A. using Pandas.

## Files used

- bikeshare.py
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

## How to use it

Just update the _csv_ files and run the Python file (_bikeshare.py_).

## FAQ

### Where are the _csv_ files?

Because of their size (they have mor than 33 MB each), they were included in the .gitignore in order to not be uploaded to the repository.

## Credits

I really would like to thank Udacity for giving real data (the _csv_ files) for me to explore in the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree program.
